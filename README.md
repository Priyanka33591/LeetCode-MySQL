# LeetCode-SQL

This repository stores SQL solutions for selected LeetCode problems. Each problem lives in its own folder named and inside each folder, the primary solution is stored in `solution.sql`.

## Repository layout

__Examples:__

- `175. Combine Two Tables/solution.sql`
- `176. Second Highest Salary/solution.sql`
- `182. Duplicate Emails/solution.sql`

Folders include the problem number followed by a short, human-friendly title. Filenames use `solution.sql` by convention so it's easy to open the SQL answer quickly.

## Naming recommendations

- Use `NNN. Short Title/solution.sql` where `NNN` is the problem number. Example: `176. Second Highest Salary/solution.sql`.
- If you prefer snake_case or hyphens, keep it consistent across the repo. Avoid trailing spaces or special characters in folder names.

## How to use

1. Open the folder for the problem you want to view.
2. Open `solution.sql` and copy the query into LeetCode's web editor to run it on the platform.

## Contributing

- Add new problems as new folders following the naming recommendation.

## Notes

- Windows accepts spaces in file and folder names (this repo uses them for readability). If you run scripts against the repo, consider using hyphens/underscores to avoid quoting issues.
- Local filenames don't affect submissions on LeetCode — you copy the query into their editor.

If you'd like, I can:

- Rename folders to a uniform convention (e.g., replace spaces with underscores).
- Add short problem descriptions or tags to each folder.
